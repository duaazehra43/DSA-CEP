# DSA-CEP Working on Daraz Roman Urdu Reviews

The significance of customer reviews in today's digital age and how they influence a brand's reputation and success is very important. We explores the analysis of customer reviews from Daraz, a popular e-commerce platform, using Python and machine learning techniques to extract valuable insights and drive business decisions.

Three critical business questions:

1. Product Quality Improvement: We employs sentiment analysis to identify common complaints and issues related to product quality by analyzing negative reviews.

2. Optimizing Supply Chain and Inventory: We delves into understanding demand fluctuations and seasonal trends to optimize inventory management and marketing strategies.

3. Promoting Sustainable Products: We searches for sustainability-related keywords in customer reviews to identify products aligning with sustainable and eco-friendly attributes.

We also discusses feature engineering, including text-based and time-based features, text preprocessing, and TF-IDF vectorization to convert text data into numerical features for machine learning.

For sentiment analysis, We uses a Logistic Regression model and evaluates its performance using metrics like accuracy and a classification report. The analysis provides insights into precision, recall, and F1-score.

In conclusion, it highlights the power of data-driven decision-making in improving product quality, optimizing operations, and meeting consumer preferences. Leveraging customer reviews and advanced analytics can be a game-changer for businesses in enhancing customer satisfaction and achieving greater success.
